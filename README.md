# heart_disease_classifier
I have developed a Machine Learning based model to predict if the patient has heart disease. In this project, I have implemented three models: 1. LogisticRegression, 2. KNeighborsClassifier, and 3. RandomForestClassifier.

This project was a part of Udemy course that i referred while learning.
